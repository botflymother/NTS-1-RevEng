## REPO INDEX
o
__/ic-datasheets__: datasheets for the various ICs on the board

__/nts1boardpics__: pictures of the board i took, multiple pictures of each side taken from the same height focused on different sections of the board, done with the intent of stitching them together to make oen really crisp and clear photo. stitching them together to make one really crisp clear photo is beyond my skill level. i did not and probably will not do it.

__/online-resource-mirrors__: copies of web pages with relevant or useful information

__README.md__: a man knocks at your door. will you answer? will you let him in? can you trust him? do you have any choice?. who even is the man? really. really now. just really **who** is that man. who does he think he is? grab the gun. sneak around back. what you do or do not do after this, is none of my concern.

__TRACING-WIP.png__: this PNG of the mapping thus far:
