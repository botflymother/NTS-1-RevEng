# NTS-1-RevEng

Reverse engineering a Rev.D Korg NTS-1. In progress.

## REPO INDEX

- __/2d-3d-data__: 2d/3d model data for the nts-1 from korgs website. i manually rewrote the .rtf instruction/disclaimer files in markdown because why the fuck would you use .rtf for any reason. honestly i dont know why i even bothered, the docs are entirely useless. should have just not included them. oh well.

- __/datasheets__: datasheets for the various ICs on the board

- __/nts1boardpics__: pictures of the board i took, multiple pictures of each side taken from the same height focused on different sections of the board, done with the intent of stitching them together to make oen really crisp and clear photo. stitching them together to make one really crisp clear photo is beyond my skill level. i did not and probably will not do it.

- __/online-resource-mirrors__: copies of web pages with relevant or useful information

- __ic-list.ods__: spreadsheet with chip labels, part numbers, names, and corresponding datasheets.

- __README.md__: a man knocks at your door. will you answer? will you let him in? can you trust him? do you have any choice?. who even is the man? really. really now. just really *who* is that man. who does he think he is? grab the gun. sneak around back. what you do or do not do after this, is none of my concern.

- __tracing-wip.png__: this PNG of the mapping thus far:

![a PNG of the mapping thus far](tracing-wip.png)

- __tracing.xcf.bz2__: the mapping. gimp project file with different types of marking on their own layers so you can turn layers on or off to highlight different aspects of the circuit. (note: gimp can open xcf.bz2 files as-is. you dont have to decompress before using.)

- __notes.txt__: .you know what a file called notes.txt is. im not going to explain it. fuck you.
