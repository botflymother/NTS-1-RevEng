NTS-1 REVERSE ENGINEERING NOTES

vim modeline, disregard:
vim: tw=79

(most likely) 6 layer internal PCB; top and bottom signal, gnd, 5v, 3.3v,
3.3vRef.

in the headphone amplifier section, the actual headphone jack goes through an
extra highpass filter stage that the audio out test points dont. i cant test it
right now but my guess is the length of the test point traces adds noise that
needs to be filtered for the actual audio out. theres no similar filter before
the test point terminates. i guess since the test points arent meant to be used
permanently the designers didnt want to add the cost of two resistors and two
caps to filter them too. 

for the life of me i can't identify IC10. markings "w1118 / 2005", 8 pin dfn
package, and its probably a small embedded speaker amplifier or something? its
part of the internal speaker circuit but im not sure on its exact role.

a very helpful person on reddit gave me some very helpful googling tips (add
the dimensions to the search (also make sure you actually get the package type
right lol)) for IDing IC10, and while i need to test it to be sure, i think im
confident enough to put it in the spreadsheet. we did it reddit

Things i think will need doing:
| |  trace front traces
|x|  trace back traces
|x|  ID vias
| |  number the vias
| |  color code railed traces
| |  label components with on board labels
| |  ID ICs
| |  ID/value passive components
| |  label individual circuit sections
| |  produce circuit diagram
| |  produce schematic
| |  produce gerber data
| |  produce BOM
| |  do a nice little write-up
