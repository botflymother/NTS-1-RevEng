NTS-1 REVERSE ENGINEERING NOTES

(most likely) 6 layer internal PCB; top and bottom signal, gnd, 5v, 3.3v, 3.3vRef.

Things i think will need doing:
| |  trace front traces
|x|  trace back traces
|x|  ID vias
| |  color code railed traces
| |  label components with on board labels
| |  ID ICs
| |  ID/value passive components
| |  produce circuit diagram
| |  produce schematic
| |  produce gerber data
| |  produce BOM
| |  do a nice little write-up
