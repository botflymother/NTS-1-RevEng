NTS-1 REVERSE ENGINEERING NOTES

(most likely) 6 layer internal PCB; top and bottom signal, gnd, 5v, 3.3v,
3.3vRef.

IC1 is a TI TPA6138A2 headphone driver. it seems to be using the typical
application circuit in the datasheet

in the headphone amplifier section, the actual headphone jack goes through an
extra highpass filter stage that the audio out test points dont. i cant test it
right now but my guess is the length of the test point traces adds noise that
needs to be filtered for the actual audio out. theres no similar filter before
the test point terminates. i guess since the test points arent meant to be used
permanently the designers didnt want to add the cost of two resistors and two
caps to filter them too. 



Things i think will need doing:
| |  trace front traces
|x|  trace back traces
|x|  ID vias
| |  number the vias
| |  color code railed traces
| |  label components with on board labels
| |  ID ICs
| |  ID/value passive components
| |  label individual circuit sections
| |  produce circuit diagram
| |  produce schematic
| |  produce gerber data
| |  produce BOM
| |  do a nice little write-up
